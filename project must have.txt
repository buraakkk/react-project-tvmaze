Hi Rob,
I want to work with the tvmaze. (https://api.tvmaze.com)
Here are the general requirements.
• The app needs to have multiple pages and use client-side routing
• The app should make use of the Context API
• You can either use an API that you have built or access to (then just include the backend code in the project) or should use data from a public API. You will not be graded on backend code
